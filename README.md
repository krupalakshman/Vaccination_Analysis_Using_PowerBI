# Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global vaccination data to understand trends in vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and effectiveness. The data is cleaned, stored in a SQL database, and visualized using Power BI dashboards to provide actionable insights for public health strategy, disease prevention, and resource allocation.

## Skills Gained

- Python Scripting
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL Database Design
- Power BI Data Visualization
- Public Health and Epidemiology Analytics

## Domain

Public Health and Epidemiology

## Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze vaccination data and disease incidence rates to:

- Assess vaccination program effectiveness across regions.
- Identify trends in vaccine coverage and disease incidence.
- Support decision-making in vaccination strategy and policy formulation.

## Business Use Cases

### Public Health Strategy

- Evaluate vaccination program effectiveness.
- Identify regions requiring targeted interventions.

### Disease Prevention

- Detect vaccine inefficacy based on disease incidence rates.
- Support decisions on booster doses and new vaccine rollouts.

### Resource Allocation

- Optimize vaccine distribution by identifying low-coverage areas.
- Forecast vaccine demand for better supply chain management.

### Global Health Policy

- Provide data-driven insights for policymakers.
- Assist governments and health organizations with vaccine strategy planning.

## Approach

### Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values.
- Standardize units and formats.
- Ensure date consistency.

### SQL Database Setup

- Create normalized relational tables.
- Maintain referential integrity with primary and foreign keys.

### Power BI Integration

- Connect Power BI to the SQL database.
- Set up scheduled data refreshes.

### Data Visualization

- Develop interactive dashboards with Power BI.
- Key visualizations include:
  - **Geographical Heatmaps**: Vaccination coverage and disease incidence by region.
  - **Trend Lines/Bar Charts**: Vaccination rates and disease trends over time.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Correlations between vaccine coverage and disease incidence.
  - **KPIs**: Progress tracking on vaccination goals.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze trends in vaccination coverage and disease incidence.
- Identify disparities across regions.

## Results and Deliverables

### Outcomes

- A structured SQL database with normalized vaccination and disease data.
- Power BI dashboards with key insights and visualizations.
- Actionable insights for public health policies and vaccination strategies.
